# Disclaimer on Maps, Geography, and Language Representation

Project ILM (Integrative Linguistic Multiscript) is an academic and engineering initiative focused on linguistic computing, transliteration systems, and software architecture research.

Any geographic visualization on this site is used only as a contextual aid to indicate regions where languages and scripts are traditionally or historically used. These visualizations are not political maps, do not represent legal boundaries, and do not express or imply any position on sovereignty, borders, or territorial status.

Map tiles and base layers are provided by third-party open-source providers and are rendered without modification. Project ILM does not control, curate, or endorse any geographic labels that may appear in external map data.

For authoritative geographic, political, or legal representations, users should consult official government sources.

This project is released under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPL v2) and is intended solely for research, educational, and experimental purposes.

# Versioning and Archival Notice
Any archival snapshot timestamped prior to those listed above reflects a time-limited experimental trial build generated during early-stage validation of user interface components and third-party visualization defaults.

That snapshot does not constitute a release, publication, or representation of Project ILM’s intended design, scope, or position. It was superseded prior to formal public beta designation and carries no authoritative or declarative status.

Project ILM makes no representations or assertions through archived intermediary artifacts that are outside the current repository state. The present repository content alone constitutes the complete, authoritative, and intended implementation of Project ILM.

Any interpretation, inference, or reliance on superseded trial artifacts is expressly disclaimed.
